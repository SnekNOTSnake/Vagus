## üéØÔ∏è Motivation

I built this project to learn how game mechanics works as well as to further learn the JavaScript langugae. More than that, I think this project will look good on Portfolio or something.

This project itself is a combination of two works: <a href="https://antiyoy.fandom.com/">Antiyoy</a> created by yiotro, and <a href="https://github.com/alcalyn/openhex">Openhex</a> created by alcalyn. My part is to make them know and be friend each other, with some spices and seasonings!

Full credits including images and tools used are mentioned in <a href="https://github.com/SnekNOTSnake/Vagus/src/components/Credits.jsx">Credits.jsx</a> file.
